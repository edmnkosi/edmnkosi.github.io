Hey there, welcome to my online graphic design portfolio, my name is Edmond nkosi. 

<br>

Born in South Africa, Mpumalanga, with ambitions of becoming a multi-talented creative, I had to travel to Durban to get my education, as there were no schools in my province, with the field of study I was looking for. 

<br>

As a result of my education, I've learned how to be create illustrations, video edit, 3d model, photo editing, art techniques, branding, communication, and of course web design. 

<br>

I hope you enjoy the experience on this site, and if your looking to hire me for anything graphic design related , you can connect with me with the links below.
